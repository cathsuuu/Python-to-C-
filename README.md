In this Video, you'll see the difference of the original python code and the c++. While making the c++ code,I realized that it is easier to compile and run the python code unlike the c++ although they have similarities, it just that when using a Python you will just need to input the data needed unlike in the c++, theres a lot of indents and necesary letters that need to be include to rub the program.
